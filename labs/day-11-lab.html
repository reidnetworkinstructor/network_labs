    <h1>Day 11 Lab</h1>
    <h2>Crimp and Test an Ethernet Cable</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Build a straight-through Ethernet cable and test it in both the real world and simulation to understand how Physical Layer (Layer 1) connections work.</p>

    <h3>Tools Needed</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>UTP cable (Cat 5e or Cat 6)</li>
      <li>2 × RJ45 connectors</li>
      <li>Crimping tool</li>
      <li>Wire stripper</li>
      <li>Optional: Cable tester</li>
      <li>Optional: Cisco Packet Tracer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 1: Prep the Cable</h3>
    <p>Cut 1–2 meters of UTP. Strip ~2 inches of the outer jacket to expose the four twisted pairs. Untwist and arrange the conductors to the <strong>T568B</strong> order:</p>
    <p><code>Orange-White, Orange, Green-White, Blue, Blue-White, Green, Brown-White, Brown</code></p>
    <p>Line the wires flat, trim evenly to ~0.5", and slide into the RJ45 with the clip facing down. <em>Orange-White</em> should be Pin 1 (left).</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Crimp It</h3>
    <p>Seat the cable fully so each wire reaches the end of the connector. Verify the order is still correct, then crimp firmly.</p>
    <p>Repeat for the other end using the <strong>same T568B pinout</strong> to make a straight-through cable.</p>
    <div class="note">
      Check the jacket is caught by the strain-relief tab and that all copper pins are fully pressed and visible.
    </div>

    <h3>Step 3: Physical Test</h3>
    <p>Plug one end into a computer and the other into a switch or router. Look for link/activity lights. Try browsing or pinging your default gateway.</p>
    <p>If you have a tester, connect both ends—lights should run 1→8 in order with no splits or reversals.</p>
    <div class="note">Example: “Crimped Cat 6 cable — link established and internet reachable.”</div>

    <h3>Step 4: Simulate It (Optional)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Packet Tracer, add two PCs and a switch.</li>
      <li>Use the <em>copper straight-through</em> tool to connect each PC to the switch.</li>
      <li>Assign IPs: PC0 = <code>192.168.1.10</code>, PC1 = <code>192.168.1.11</code>.</li>
      <li>From PC0, ping PC1. You should receive replies.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">Result: “Simulated cable working — ping reply received.”</div>

    <h3>Step 5: Reflect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How does a properly crimped cable enable Layer 1 communication?</li>
      <li>Why use the same T568B standard on both ends for a straight-through cable?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Standard pinouts ensure correct transmit/receive pair alignment between devices.</p>
