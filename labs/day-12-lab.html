    <h2>Test Wireless Range with WiFi SweetSpots</h2>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use a mobile app to test how distance and frequency affect your Wi-Fi signal.</p>

    <h3>üõ† Tools Needed:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Smartphone or tablet (iOS/Android)</li>
      <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wifi-sweetspots/id855457383" target="_blank">WiFi SweetSpots</a> (free app)</li>
      <li>Home Wi-Fi network</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 1: Download the App</h3>
    <p>Go to the App Store or Google Play and download <strong>WiFi SweetSpots</strong>. It‚Äôs free and doesn't require an account.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Measure Signal Strength Near Your Router</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand about 2‚Äì3 feet from your router.</li>
      <li>Open the app and run a 30-second test.</li>
      <li>Take note of the signal (e.g., <code>-30 dBm</code>) and the Wi-Fi band you're on (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz).</li>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> ‚Äú2.4 GHz near router: -30 dBm‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Move Further Away</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Move 10‚Äì20 feet away, ideally with a wall or two between you and the router.</li>
      <li>Run the test again.</li>
      <li>Record the results (e.g., <code>-70 dBm</code>).</li>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> ‚Äú2.4 GHz, -70 dBm far from router‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Test a Different Frequency</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If your router supports it, switch your phone to the 5 GHz band using your Wi-Fi settings.</li>
      <li>Repeat the near and far measurements.</li>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> ‚Äú5 GHz, -40 dBm near / -80 dBm far‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 5: Reflect</h3>
    <p>Write a short paragraph answering the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      How did the signal strength change as you moved away? How did the 2.4 GHz vs. 5 GHz bands compare? 
    </blockquote>
    <p>Hint: 2.4 GHz travels farther but may be slower; 5 GHz is faster but weaker through walls.</p>

    <hr />
    <p><strong>Lab Summary:</strong> This experiment shows how physical distance and frequency impact your wireless network signal strength. Signal strength (dBm) drops as you move away, and 5 GHz weakens more rapidly than 2.4 GHz due to its higher frequency.</p>
