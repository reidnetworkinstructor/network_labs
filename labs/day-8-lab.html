    <h1>Analyze Network Traffic with Wireshark</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Capture HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS traffic to see ports and protocols in action.</p>
  </header>
  <main class="lab-content">
    <section>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, observing how application-layer protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS use specific ports, and identify the role of ports in communication.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tool Needed</h2>
      <p>Wireshark (free, download from <a href="https://www.wireshark.org" target="_blank">wireshark.org</a>) — a network protocol analyzer for capturing and analyzing traffic.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 1: Install and Set Up Wireshark</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Download Wireshark and install it on your computer (you may also be prompted to install Npcap).</li>
        <li>Open Wireshark and select your active network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).</li>
        <li>Click the green shark fin icon to begin capturing packets.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2: Generate and Capture HTTP Traffic</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In your browser, visit a non-secure site using <code>http://</code> (e.g., <code>http://example.com</code>).</li>
        <li>Stop the capture in Wireshark after the page loads (red square icon).</li>
        <li>In the filter bar, type <code>tcp.port == 80</code> and press Enter.</li>
        <li>Look for packets with “HTTP” in the Protocol column and inspect their source/destination ports.</li>
        <li>Note: “HTTP traffic on port 80, source port [random], destination port 80.”</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3: Generate and Capture HTTPS and DNS Traffic</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start a new capture.</li>
        <li>Visit <code>https://google.com</code> in your browser.</li>
        <li>Stop the capture.</li>
        <li>Filter for HTTPS: <code>tcp.port == 443</code>. Look for “TLS” packets.</li>
        <li>Filter for DNS: <code>udp.port == 53</code>. Look for “DNS” packets with queries and responses.</li>
        <li>Note: “HTTPS traffic on port 443, DNS query for google.com on port 53.”</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 4: Reflect</h2>
      <p>Write a paragraph answering: How did Wireshark help you understand the role of ports in network communication? What did you learn about protocol-port relationships?</p>
      <p><em>Hint: HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on 443, DNS on 53 — ports route the traffic
