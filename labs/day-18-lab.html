    <h1>Day 18 Lab</h1>
    <h2>Measure Performance with iPerf</h2>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use iPerf to test throughput and jitter across your network, gaining insight into real-time performance.</p>

    <h3>üõ† Tools Needed:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://iperf.fr" target="_blank">iPerf3</a> (free, open-source)</li>
      <li>Two devices on the same network (e.g., PC + laptop or phone)</li>
      <li>Wi-Fi connection (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 1: Install and Set Up iPerf3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Download iPerf3 on both devices (PC as server, laptop/phone as client).</li>
      <li>No admin rights needed‚Äîjust extract and run via terminal or Command Prompt.</li>
      <li>Ensure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Run Initial Test</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>On the server (e.g., PC), open terminal and run: <code>iperf3 -s</code></li>
      <li>On the client (e.g., laptop), run: <code>iperf3 -c [server IP]</code> (e.g., <code>iperf3 -c 192.168.1.100</code>)</li>
      <li>Review output for throughput and jitter (e.g., ‚Äú40 Mbps, 2 ms jitter‚Äù).</li>
      <li><strong>Log:</strong> ‚ÄúBaseline test: 40 Mbps, 2 ms jitter on 2.4 GHz.‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Simulate Load</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>While running the test again, stream a video or download a large file on the client device.</li>
      <li>Rerun the iPerf test. Are speeds down? Jitter up?</li>
      <li>Switch to 5 GHz if available‚Äîmost modern routers and devices support this.</li>
      <li>Run test again on 5 GHz. Look for improvement (e.g., ‚Äú45 Mbps, 1 ms jitter‚Äù).</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> ‚ÄúVideo load reduced performance. 5 GHz improved speed and reduced jitter.‚Äù</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Reflect</h3>
    <p>Write a brief reflection: What affected your performance? What conditions helped throughput improve? What did iPerf reveal about your network?</p>
    <p>Hint: Throughput is affected by both bandwidth and congestion. Jitter reflects consistency‚Äîkey for streaming and VoIP.</p>

    <hr />
    <p><strong>Lab Summary:</strong> By measuring performance with iPerf, you now understand how to benchmark and improve wireless throughput. You also saw how interference and frequency band choice impact network speed and stability.</p>
