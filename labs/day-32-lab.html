      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Analyze a real-world data breach and map how security frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, or HIPAA could have helped prevent it.</p>

      <h3>ðŸ›  Tools Needed:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Web browser</li>
        <li>News search or breach database (e.g., <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">HaveIBeenPwned</a>, Google News)</li>
        <li>One of the following frameworks:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework" target="_blank">NIST Cybersecurity Framework</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html" target="_blank">ISO/IEC 27001</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html" target="_blank">HIPAA Security Rule</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 1: Choose a Breach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Search for a known cybersecurity breach (Target, Equifax, Capital One, etc.)</li>
        <li>Find an article or report that includes key details (what happened, how it happened)</li>
        <li>Copy the URL and bookmark it</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2: Identify Failures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What security controls failed?</li>
        <li>Was it human error, poor access control, outdated software, lack of monitoring?</li>
        <li>List at least 3 weaknesses that were exploited</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 3: Map to a Framework</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick one framework (e.g., NIST)</li>
        <li>Identify at least 3 controls that would have helped mitigate the breach</li>
        <li>Example (NIST): PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are managed</li>
        <li>Write a 2â€“3 sentence justification for each control</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 4: Reflection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What was the biggest takeaway from mapping the framework?</li>
        <li>Did you find the framework too vague or helpful?</li>
        <li>How could an organization stay compliant and still move quickly?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Lab Summary:</strong> Youâ€™ve taken a real cybersecurity event and reverse-engineered it using a professional compliance lens. This exercise shows how frameworks aren't just theory â€” they prevent real damage.</p>
