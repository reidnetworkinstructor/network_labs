    <h2>Map a Packet’s Journey Through the OSI Model</h2>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Trace the path of a packet as it moves through the 7 layers of the OSI model when accessing a website like <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">google.com</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Pen and paper or a free diagramming tool (e.g., <a href="https://draw.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">draw.io</a>).</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Scenario Setup</h3>
    <p>Imagine this situation: You open your browser and type in <code>google.com</code>. What happens behind the scenes as that request moves through the network?</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Trace the Packet Through the OSI Layers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Layer 7 (Application):</strong> Your browser (e.g., Chrome) creates an HTTP(S) request to access <code>google.com</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer 6 (Presentation):</strong> The request is formatted and encrypted using TLS for HTTPS so it can be transmitted securely.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer 5 (Session):</strong> A session is established between your browser and Google’s server to manage and maintain the conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer 4 (Transport):</strong> TCP segments the data, assigns ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS), and ensures reliable delivery with acknowledgments.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer 3 (Network):</strong> IP addresses are used for routing. Your gateway/router forwards packets toward the destination server’s IP.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer 2 (Data Link):</strong> Frames are built with MAC addresses and sent over your local network (Wi‑Fi or Ethernet).</li>
      <li><strong>Layer 1 (Physical):</strong> Bits travel as electrical signals, light, or radio waves across the physical medium.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Visualize the Journey</h3>
    <p>Create a simple diagram of the path:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Path:</strong> Your Computer → Router/Gateway → Internet → Google’s Server</li>
      <li>Label what each OSI layer is doing at each hop.</li>
      <li>Use arrows/boxes to show flow from request to response.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Portfolio Tip:</strong> Export your diagram as an image or PDF and include it in an ePortfolio entry explaining each OSI layer’s role.</p>
