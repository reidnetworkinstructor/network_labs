      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>Trace the path of a packet as it moves through the 7 layers of the OSI model when accessing a website like google.com.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 1: Scenario Setup</h2>
      <p>Imagine this situation: You open your browser and type in <code>google.com</code>. What happens behind the scenes as that request moves through the network?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2: Trace the Packet Through the OSI Layers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Layer 7 (Application):</strong> Your browser (e.g., Chrome) creates an HTTP request to access <code>google.com</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 6 (Presentation):</strong> The request is formatted and encrypted using HTTPS for secure transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 5 (Session):</strong> A session is established between your browser and Google’s server to manage communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 4 (Transport):</strong> TCP breaks the request into packets and ensures reliable delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 3 (Network):</strong> Your router assigns a source IP address and routes the packets toward Google’s server IP.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 2 (Data Link):</strong> Each packet is framed and sent over your local network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 1 (Physical):</strong> Data travels as electrical signals, light, or radio waves across the physical medium.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3: Visualize the Journey</h2>
      <p>Create a diagram that shows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Computer → Router → Internet → Google’s Server</li>
        <li>Label the function of each OSI layer along the journey.</li>
        <li>Use arrows or boxes to represent each step.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Portfolio Tip:</strong> Export your diagram as an image or PDF and include it as proof of your understanding of the OSI model.</p>
